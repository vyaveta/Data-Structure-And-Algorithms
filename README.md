# Data Structure and Algorithms in Typescript

## Contains the code and explanation to implement popular/common datastructures and algorithms.

This repo helps not only helps you to learn DataStructures and algorithms, but also Typescript,
This repo contains the advanced way of how to make your code shorter in Typescript/Javascript.

## What you will learn from this repo
### Arrays =>
             * Binary Search in Array
             * Linear Search in Array
### Linked List => 
             * How to create a singly linked list
             * How to create a doubly linked list
             * Sort in singly and doubly linked list
             * Add elements to head and tail in linked list
             * Find an element with its index number
             * Find an element with its value
             * Delete Elements from head and tail
             * Print all elements in linked list
### Strings => 
             * Check if the string is pallindrome or not
             * Reversing the given string
### Sorting Algorithms => 
             * Bubble Sort
             * Insertion Sort
             * Quick Sort
             * Selection Sort (in Array and in Linked list)
### What are the other things you will learn =>

### Interfaces in Typescript
#### you will also learn some tip and tricks to make your code shorter. For example :-
* You will learn how to swap 2 values in a variable without using a third variable,
* how to write if condition and statement in a single line, 
* reduce the use of curly brackets and so on...
